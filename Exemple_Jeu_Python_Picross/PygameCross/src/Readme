How to play
~-~-~-~-~-~~-~-~-~-~-~
  
 Use the LEFT mouse button to put a square and the RIGHT 
 button to put an equis.

 Picross is a logic puzzle in which cells in a grid have 
 to be colored or left blank according to numbers given 
 at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In 
 this puzzle type, the numbers measure how many unbroken
 lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row 
 or column. For example, a clue of "4 8 3" would mean 
 there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares,
 in that order, with at least one blank square between 
 successive groups.
